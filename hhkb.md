How I Use HHKB.

My HHKB is HHKB2 type-s, which is awesome for engineers, no matter *nix or Windows developers.


## Karabiner


When I put hhkb on my Macbook, the builtin keyboard's keys may be pressed accidently sometimes. Karabiner helps to disable the builtin keyboard when HHKB is connected.


## Up/Down/Left/Right

In Vim mode, I have hjkl

In Command line mode, I have Ctrl + pnbf

Other conditions, I have fn + [/;'
